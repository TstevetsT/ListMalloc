NAME

       l_malloc

SYNOPSIS

       void *l_malloc (unsigned int size);
       void *l_calloc(unsigned int nmemb, unsigned int size);
       void *l_realloc(void *ptr, unsigned int size);
       void l_free(void *ptr);
       
DESCRIPTION


       l_malloc()  allocates size of bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated 
       memory.  The memory is not initialized or cleared.   The data structure 
       used to allocate memory is shown below.
       
              Blocks
       ---------------------    <-- Memory Ptr of Header
       ||  Size + Status  ||    4 Bytes Lowest bit is used for flag
       ---------------------    <-- Memory Ptr Addr Returned
       ||  Free Space     ||    Space available to the calling process
       ---------------------
       
       Allocated block headers are 4 bytes in size. The minimum block
       allocation is 4 bytes. With no space for user data. This will keep 
       free blocks aligned in the heap. If any blocks are 4 bytes in size
       it will automatically be added to the allocation.  The heap is
       initialized by adjusting the break by 4000 KB.  When bytes are requested
       a walk down the storage viewing the headers of each block will occur.  
       The size of block is used to find start of subsequent blocks. 
       If an exact size match is encountered, it will be used.  As each block 
       is tested, a pointer to the smallest block that is big enough for data is 
       maintained.  When the bottom of the heap is reached, if a block has been 
       identified it is used.  If a big enough block was not found, the heap 
       will be grown by the requested block size.  
       
       Size (4 Bytes)
       Size of allocated blocks can be up to a default 100,000 bytes in size 
       change HEAPMAX to a large size to modify the max intial size of the heap 
       located in malloc.asm
       
       Status (LSB) - uses AND operation to determine whether a status flag is
       utilized or not.
       
       00000000 - indicates the block is free
       00000001 - indicates the block is allocated
       
       When a block of memory is freed the entire heap will be checked for blocks
       to coalesce due to the absence of a previous pointer and next pointer within
       the header information for a given block.
       
       l_calloc() and l_realloc() are extensions of l_malloc(). When one of these
       companion functions are called l_malloc() will be invoked. l_calloc ()
       allocates a block of memory and then the resulting block of memory is filled
       with zeroes. l_realloc() allocates a new block of memory when the first 
       argument is null of the requested size. If a pointer is passed to l_realloc()
       in the first argument it will allocate a block of memory of a the specified
       size in argument two and then copy the first argument pointer into the new 
       allocated block of memory. If the new memory block you copy into is smaller
       than the previous pointer then part of the copy will not be successful.
       
       l_free() is used to free blocks of memory that have been allocated by
       l_malloc(). When l_free() frees a block of memory it will then merge the
       entire heap starting from the highest address (or the beginning of the heap).
       If l_free() finds that the entire heap is empty when the caller invokes
       l_free() it will free the entire heap back to the kernel.
       
 
 RETURN VALUE
 
       On success, l_malloc(), l_calloc(), l_realloc(), returns a pointer to a
       reserved block of memory in the heap.  On error or failure, NULL is returned. 
       On success, l_free() release the memory pointed to by ptr. If the ptr 
       is NULL no action is taken.
       
 NOTES
 
       The priority for malloc is ensuring the maximum amount of space available
       for the calling process/function.  Usable space has more priority than
       speed, and this resulted in a smaller header but more overhead to process
       changes to the heap during coalescence (consolidating free space).
