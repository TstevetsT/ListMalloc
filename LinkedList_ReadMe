       linked list

SYNOPSIS

       struct _List3140 *listNew();
       int listInit(struct _List3140 *list);
       int addHead(struct _List3140 *list, int val);
       int removeHead(struct _List3140 *list, int *val);
       int addTail(struct _List3140 *list, int val);
       int itemAt(struct _List3140 *list, unsigned int n, int *val);
       int removeItem(struct _List3140 *list, unsigned int n, int *val);
       unsigned int size(struct _List3140 *list);
       void clear(struct _List3140 *list);
       
       
DESCRIPTION

       The first node that is allocated in any list will be the admin node.
       The admin node keeps track of the total number of nodes in the list, 
       the head of the list (the 0 value of index), and the tail of the list (the 
       n value of index). The admin node uses the same structure as the
       regular node. If the values in the admin node are null this means there 
       are no nodes currently in the list.

                                    Structure of the List

       struc _List3140
       
       	.above: resd 1		 above is the ptr to highest index in the list or
       	                           holds the tail of a list or null if there are no nodes
       	                           
       	.value:	resd 1		  value holds the integer value in the node or
       	                           value holds the number of nodes in the list or null
       	                           
       	.below:	resd 1		 below is the ptr to the lowest index in the list or
       	                           holds the head of a list or null if there are no nodes
       endstruc
       
       Implementation of the linked list uses malloc3140.asm to allocate
       blocks of memory for the list. Specifically it will use l_malloc () and
       l_free () as needed. Each node by default consumes 12 bytes. 
       
 
 RETURN VALUE
 
       On success, listNew () returns a pointer to the newly allocated list or NULL 
       on error. listInit (), addHead (),  removeHead (), removeTail (), itemAt (), 
       removeItem (),  and addTail () all returns 0 on failure or 1 on success. size ()
       returns the number of nodes in the list on success or 0 if the list is empty.
       clear () has no return value.
       
 NOTES
       
       listNew () allocates and initializes a new list. For the initialization it uses 
       listInit () in order to initialize all the values to zero.
       
       itemAt (), removeHead (), removeTail (), and removeItem (), will all return
       the value removed in the ptr given in the *val argument if it is not NULL. If 
       the field in this argument is NULL then the function will return 0 indicating
       an error.
       
       clear () will remove all the nodes that are currently in the list and also set
       the data fields inside the node to zero. Keep in mind that if nodes are removed
       with removeHead (), removeTail (), or removeItem () those particular nodes
       will NOT have their data fields replaced by zeroes because they were removed
       from the list prior to the clear () call.
       
       The following is a demonstration of how the linked list is implemented and
       adds nodes for reference. This example assumes that listnew() is being used
       to allocate and initialize the list.
       
       listnew()		addHead() = node 1
       ----------	
       |  Tail    |	<- 0x0001
       |  Size   | <- +1
       |  Head  | <- 0x0001
       
       listnew()		node 1			addHead()
       ----------	
       |  0x0001    |	0x0001  0x0002
       |  1   |  				int val	int val
       |  0x0001  | 0x0001 0x0002
